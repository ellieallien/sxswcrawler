SXSW Crawler 2015

This is a set of scripts for crawling SXSW and getting music for all
the bands.  It changes every year, and there is no guarantee this will
work.

I'm even going to check this in with the latest crawl data so you
don't have to abuse SXSW anymore.

1. Run the crawl to get data.

  cd scripts
  ./1_run_crawl.sh

2. Collect metadata

Soundclound artists do not have songs, they have artist data listed,
so we need to find their most popular song and download it.

Dependencies:
  easy_install requests
  easy_install soundcloud

./get_sc_data.py
