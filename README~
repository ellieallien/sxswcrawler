SXSW Crawler 2015
=======================

This is a set of hacked-together scripts for crawling SXSW and getting
music for all the bands. The site formats change every year, and there
is no guarantee this will work. It is, however, a good starting place.

The process (For me, anyway) works like this:

  1. Download all songs.
  2. Feed into iTunes
  3. Rate with iTunes rater (github.com/netik/iTunesRater)
  4. Take that library and convert it into a schedule using jwz's
     scrape-sxsw.pl script
  5. Take that schedule (as an ICS file) and put it into your 
     phone to have during the event. 

Caveats: I am not responsible for what you do with these scripts. Most
of the music is copyrighted and you shouldn't steal it. Please don't
abuse the bandwidth of any of these sites. 

1. Run the crawl to get data.

  cd scripts
  ./1_run_crawl.sh

2. Collect metadata

There are usually a few different sources of music. 

Youtube 
========

We'll use jwz's youtubedown to get these files as mp4s. We'll then
convert them to mp3s


none - You can deal
  with this yourself, at a later date.

  soundcloud - special case. 

  Soundclound artists do not have songs, they have artist data listed,
  but we want to hear them to know if we should bother going to the show.

  We need to find their most popular song and download it.

Dependencies:
  easy_install requests
  easy_install soundcloud

./get_sc_data.py
