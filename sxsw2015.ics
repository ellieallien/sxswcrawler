 2013) and 'Sonne' (2014) under his moniker Rival Consoles\, West has gained a re

 ideas. Like many electronic artists\, he spent his early years experimenting wi
 th IDM\, glitch and dance\, but one consistent element in his musical journey ha
 s been his desire to create a more organic\, humanised sound. Through these expe
 rimentations he has found a process of producing electronic music that feels clo

 West engages his hands directly with instruments and is very selective about wh

 re-code the electronic music narrative with a more worldly and cosmological pre
 sence than the genre would normally dictate. Their songs are rich in variance an
 d full of vividness\, spanning across their entire debut LP Kalaboogie . Drawing
 in guitar\, flute\, percussion and synth\, the Montreal and Toronto-based sibli
 ngs Allie\, Jaclyn and Trevor Blumas act as aural anthropologists\, teaming reli
 cs of cross cultural traditions like chanting and repetition over seismic ripple
 s of deep bass. Doomsquad‚Äôs mixing of influences leaves you feeling awakened..

 town of Dingle\, Walking on Cars are one of Ireland's best kept secrets. They'v
 e been selling out arena tours in the Emerald Isle for the past year\, with almo
 st every video they post receiving upwards of 400k views online (from their Iris
 h audience alone). Not bad for a group of friends from a town with a population 
 of 1500\, that boasts a pet Dolphin (who answers to the name of Fungi) in its ha
 rbour and a hardware store that doubles as a late night drinking den. \n \n
 Having met at school\, lead singer Patrick\, pianist Sorcha\, lead guitarist Da
 n\, bassist Paul and drummer Evan played their first ever gig at a youth cafe in
 their hometown of Dingle and a year later decided to break out and tour their m
 usic around the country. Needless to say it was hugely well received and the ban

 for Best Pop Band in New York 2014\, PARLOUR TRICKS has been hailed as \"the p

 makes for a kind of indie pop symmetry that somehow sounds \"50's nostalgic\, 9
 0's familiar\, and 2020 progressive all at once\" (The Most Definitely). With th
 eir \"punchy\, infectious\, danceable rhythms\, clean guitar\, dirty synth\, and
 heavenly voices\" (Village Voice) it's not too hard to see why Spotify took a s

 his desire to create a more organic\, humanised sound. Through these experiment

 this urge. Restricting himself to a small selection of analogue equipment\, West
 engages his hands directly with instruments and is very selective about what he
 then records into the computer. He reduces musical parts even further\, leaving

DESCRIPTION:Pop ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ \nCalgary\, AB\, CANADA \n \nSamantha Savage Smith is a sing
 er\, guitarist\, and songwriter based in Calgary\, Alberta. Upon the release of 
 her debut album Tough Cookie in 2011\, the bulk of the critical acclaim it recei
 ved was rightly placed upon her startling\, unique voice\, which seems at once f
 amiliar and totally new. The album was deemed \"Best of 2011\" by the Calgary He
 rald\, FFWD Weekly\, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix\, and the Vancouver Sun\, and led to
 a string of CBC and CKUA performances and two acclaimed music videos for her so
 ngs \"You Always Come To Mind\" and \"The Score\". \n \n The key to Smith'
 s songs is that she has an ability to infuse her songs with a certain timelessne
 ss\, invoking a familiarity within each listener\, while still bringing formidab
 le sense of self to the proceedings. This potent combination of traits belies th
 e eclecticness of her own musical touchstones\, which run the gamut from Anita O
 'Day and Kurt Vile to Land of Talk and Eric's Trip. \n ....\ \nhttp://samanth

DESCRIPTION:Rock ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ \nCalgary\, AB\, CANADA \n \nViet Cong is a canny fusion of
 four quite distinct voices from their home town of Calgary\, Alberta. Featuring
 former members of the much-loved ‚Äîbut sadly defunct‚Äî band Women\, and membe
 rs of Chad VanGaalen‚Äôs backing band\, Viet Cong offers up an intriguing mixtur
 e of sharply-angled rhythm workouts and euphoric ‚Äò60s garage pop-esque melodie
 s. This open-ended framework is balanced with a penchant for drone-y\, VU-styled
 downer moments\, altogether spinning what has been called ‚Äúeasily one of the 
 best new Canadian bands in quite some time.‚Äù On stage\, Viet Cong is hugely en
 gaging\, delivering pop gems and instrumental acrobatics with equal aplomb\, cle
 arly delighting in the navigation of these catchy\, intricate songs. Viet Cong's
 self-titled debut LP is coming out on January 20\, 2015 via Jagjaguwar Records.

DESCRIPTION:Rock ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ \nLos Angeles\, CA \n \nGenevieve is a born singer. As with
 contemporaries like Sia or Thom Yorke\, Genevieve has that rare capacity to cha

 the wide spectrum of her vocal range\, the inventive tonal subtleties- into pu
 re expressive meaning. And like Bjork or Fiona Apple\, her voice is so much bigg

 is herself transformed by it into an almost otherworldly character onstage. \n
