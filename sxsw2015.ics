DESCRIPTION:Pop \n \nSamantha Savage Smith is a singer\, guitarist\, and songwriter base
 d in Calgary\, Alberta. Upon the release of her debut album Tough Cookie in 2011
 \, the bulk of the critical acclaim it received was rightly placed upon her star
 tling\, unique voice\, which seems at once familiar and totally new. The album w
 as deemed \"Best of 2011\" by the Calgary Herald\, FFWD Weekly\, Saskatoon Star-
 Phoenix\, and the Vancouver Sun\, and led to a string of CBC and CKUA performanc
 es and two acclaimed music videos for her songs \"You Always Come To Mind\" and 
 \"The Score\". \n \n The key to Smith's songs is that she has an ability t
 o infuse her songs with a certain timelessness\, invoking a familiarity within e
 ach listener\, while still bringing formidable sense of self to the proceedings.
 This potent combination of traits belies the eclecticness of her own musical to
 uchstones\, which run the gamut from Anita O'Day and Kurt Vile to Land of Talk a
 nd Eric's Trip. \n ....\ \nhttp://samanthasavagesmith.bandcamp.com/

DESCRIPTION:Pop \n \nCaptivating bedroom pop with a karaoke video/soft haze filter on it
 that collapses the textural dimensions of music to an appealing\, shiny finish.
 The music of Part Time owes a debt to ‚Äò80s movie scores\, neon lights\, fog m
 achines and nightlife\, a generous sampling of New Romance in a post-capitalist 
 world\, its heart going out to everyone who hasn‚Äôt abandoned their silk shirts
 in favor of more practical attire. The home studio shell and canned dynamics of
 Part Time quickly dissolve to reveal some serious jammers in the midst\, the im
 age of a man pouring his heart out into the psychotropic fronds of the lounge at
 the Venusian Holiday Inn. Pour yourself a yard of liquid acid and float along..

 ring the good news. \n \n They are fresh air into today's gospel industr

 tarted life as a bunch of friends who had played together in their teens in ‚Äúv
 arious crap bands‚Äù. Nothing had ever been taken seriously\, apart from the gri

 with the avowed aim to make ‚Äúobnoxious pop‚Äù. \n \n They quickly made 
 waves on the Irish gig scene with their powerful\,confrontational live performan
 ces. \n They released their first EP\, entitled ‚ÄòHow Am I Supposed To Kill Y

DESCRIPTION:Rock \n \nSophie Villy - remarkebly promising singer/songwriter\, known for 
 her unique performing style. Minimalistic arrangments\, vintage guitar's distinc
 tive twang and soulful timbre of voice open up another deep world\, full of grac
 e and intelligence\, nurtured in the bohemian quarters of Georgian culture. In 2
 008 she was hiding from warfare in her homeland\, but has since moved to her mot
 herland Kiev\, Ukraine. Artists were common visitors to Sophie's childhood home 
 in Tbilisi\, they undoubtedly left their mark. We hear\, as a result\, both the 
 voices of modern neighbors and the echoes of twelfth-century poet Shota Rustavel
 i. Grounded in that multifaceted heritage\, Sophie's debut album \"Mother Fish\"
 took a wide range of private stories to the outside world. Her second album \"D
 ress\"\, released in may 2014\, is already a different story and attitude of her
 to art and life in general. \"Dressed in myself I walk\, I walk\, I walk\"..

 the weak\, so they've chosen the path of optimum mayhem and tomfoolery. In their
 rollicking career\, they have been called everything from the flagship act of t

 they met up with leading Italian producer Max Casacci and Swedish band I Used t

 the hook heavy hits of The Cars to the spacey\, hypnotic sounds of the late 80'

 ted my songs to be part of a visual project\, but the visuals never became anyth
 ing concrete and only stayed in my imagination\, which was how the name of the p
 roject came about: Fotogramas\" (which translates to ‚Äòmovie frames‚Äô). Later 
 that same year\, Daniel digitally launched the first work of the band\, \"Instru
 mental EP\;\" five instrumental songs that blended sounds of folk indie with noi
 sy shoegaze guitars. \n \n After receiving rave reviews of that first album

DESCRIPTION:Country \n \nAt once both beautiful and haunting\, the chilling power of Luc
 ette‚Äôs gentle voice is unwavering and undeniable. Although young\, it is obvi
 ous to all those who listen to her that Lucette is an old and doggedly romantic 
 soul. Full of emotion\, her performances take audiences back to the days when ar
 tists such as Neil Young\, Emmylou Harris\, and Loretta Lynn dominated the airwa
 ves. \n \n The single \"Bobby Reid\" off of Lucette's debut album\, Black i
 s the Color\, was completed in just one take\, capturing the raw and melancholy 
 fluctuations of her effortless and mysterious sound. Teaming up with Blake Judd
 of Judd Films to shoot the track's music video\, Lucette commented\, \"I feel t
 ruly fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work with such amazing peop
 le on the 'Bobby Reid' video. Blake Judd (with Judd Films) really believed in th
 e project and believed in bringing the song to life.\" The video\, which feature

DESCRIPTION:Pop \n \nOcellot was formed three years ago in the northern parts of Catalon
 ia\, Spain. The group had two members\, Marc Fernandez\, guitarist and vocalist 
 and Elaine Phelan on synths. Since then the group has evolved into a five member
 piece and has recorded a self entitled EP \"Ocellot\" which was able to conquer
 the interest of specialized critics and the general public. Their first album \"
 Molsa Molsa\" was released in November 2013. With this new work\, the band who 
 are currently based in Barcelona\, have perfected the very root of their music\,
 bringing more consistency and personality to the basic but enveloping dose of p
 sychedelia found in the loops characteristic to their music. \n \n Amongst 
 the principal features of this new album one can appreciate a special devotion t
 o a sound inspired by the psychedelic and baroque nature of 1960s pop music\, bu
 t interpreted in a very way. The new formation is made up of guitar and vocals\,
 synthes....\ \nhttp://famelic.com/grups/ocellot/

DESCRIPTION:Rock \n \nIt's funny. The Tontons don't have a readily available mainstream 
 band to make an off-the-cuff comparison\, so in this space we won't tell you the
 y sound like Indie Flavor Of The Week or Noted And Weighty Classic Rock Name. Th
 e Tontons simply sound like the Tontons. That sounds like false bluster\, but an
 yone who has been tracking them since 2008 will tell you the same thing. Up fron
 t is Asli Omar\, that vocal vixen who can make men and rock nerds alike quake in
 their boots. Bassist Tom Nguyen\, whose rumble forms the dermis of the band and
 then them boys Adam and Justin Martinez come in with titanic guitars and drums 
 to make sure you are still moving your feet. This is a band that has been fully 
 embraced by their native Houston\, and the Tontons have hugged the city back wit
 h relentless gigging around town\, and now it's time for the world to get some l
 ove from The Tontons.\ \nhttp://thetontons.com

DESCRIPTION:R&amp\;B \n \nThe Suffers are a ten-piece band from Houston\, TX who are red
 efining the sound of Gulf Coast Soul\, intertwining elements of Classic American
 Soul with Rock & Roll. Both sonically and visually arresting\, the large ense
 mble packs each position of the rhythm section and horn section with a level of 
 talent and taste that provides the perfect foundation for singer Kam Franklin‚Äô
 s massive voice. The band‚Äôs sincerity and emotion are laid bare in their music
 \, which has garnered an audience so broad and varied that they may prove to be 
 the panacea for a jaded and stratified live music scene. \n \n The Suffers‚
 Äô ten-piece line up was curated by bassist Adam Castaneda and keyboardist/songw
