 llection of songs about realizing what is real and what is an illusion and learn
 ing to tell the difference\; It's about letting go of the things that cannot be 
 changed. The name of Verona comes from Shakespeare’s earliest known play\, Two
 Gentlemen of Verona\, which has the smallest cast of any of the Shakespeare pla

 st emulating what we were hearing.\" The duo formed their music organically\, im
 provising over loops that eventually materialized into full-fledged compositions
 . Rather than relying on triggering loops\, or quantization\, Teengirl Fantasy's
 music has always been performed and composed live\, resulting in a form of disc
 ourse between the band and their instruments. The result is a-typical for electr
 onic dance music- colourful\, maximalist textures and tones that move along with
 a driving rhythm yet still retain a distinctly human and emotional core. \n
